        <img src="./tomato-and-basil-soup.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a deliciously creamy tomato soup with the essence of basil. Using coconut milk instead of cream creates a rich in flavor and tasty dairy-free, gluten-free soup.</p>
        <p>This is a small twist to a traditional comforting soup. You can make it even better serving grilled cheese toast along this soup</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>2 tbsp coconut Optional</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, finelly chopped</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat coconut oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Saute onion in hot coconut oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir tomato paste and garlic with the onion; cook and stir until the garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes more</li>
            <li>Sprinkle flour over the onion mixture and stir to incorporate; add vegetable broth, crushed tomatoes, chopped basil, lemon juice, maple syrup, and bay leaf. Bring the broth to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the tomatoes are completely softened, about 20 minutes</li>
            <li>Turn heat below pot off. Remove and discard bay leaf. Pour soup into a blender. Hold lid in place and pulse blender a few times to get mixture moving before leaving on to blend into a puree; pour pureed soup into the pot and place over medium-low heat</li>
            <li>Stir coconut milk into pureed soup until the color is consistent; heat until the soup is warmed. Season soup with sea salt and garnish with fresh basil sprigs.</li>
