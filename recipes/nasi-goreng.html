        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Nasi Goreng is the popular Indonesian fried rice which is traditionally served with a fried egg. Its rice has an unique dark brown, caramelised colour. It’s a simple recipe, you won’t need to hunt down any unusual ingredients, and it’s one of the world's favourite Indonesian food.</p>
            <p>The literal translation of Nasi Goreng is “fried rice” in Indonesian and Malaysian – and that’s exactly what it is! It’s mainly rice with just a little bit of meat and just onion for the vegetables. The thing that distinguishes it from other Fried Rice dishes is the sauce which is made with kecap manis, a sweet soy sauce that stains the rice dark brown and caramelises the rice when it cooks.</p>
            <p>Typically it’s served with a sunny side up egg (love how the yolk runs into the rice!) and a side of fresh cucumber and tomato (no dressing) to make a meal of it.</p>
